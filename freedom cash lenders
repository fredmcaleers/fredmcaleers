Payday loans are very short-term, low-amount loans that provide quick cash. Unlike installment loans, they are not typically available through a bank or credit union. Instead, you have to apply through a storefront payday lender or an online lender. 

Payday lenders usually don't run a credit check, so your credit score won't take a hit.3 Also, they don't typically report your loan information to the three major credit bureaus, so neither on-time payments nor missed payments will impact your credit score.4 However, if you fail to repay the loan, the payday lender could sell the debt to a debt collector or sue you in court for the amount due. These events could be reported, and your credit could take a serious hit.
