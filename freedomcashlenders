Repayment terms can range from a several months to a several years. The interest rate, which is typically a fixed rate, depends on your credit score and history, your income, your existing debt, the loan term and amount, and current interest rates.

In general, if you have a strong credit history with a good credit score and a low amount of debt, you could qualify for a lower interest rate than borrowers with poor credit score and a higher level of debt. Every lender has its own minimum credit score requirement, so it's worth finding that out before you apply.
